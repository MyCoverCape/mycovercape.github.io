                                Being involved with children and safeguarding as a teacher, respite carer and father, it struck me there was no protective
                                garment for children. As a gym user, we are all required to use the facilities provided for our health and hygiene such as
                                changing areas, changing rooms, showers etc. When taking my daughter to swimming I realised it was hard for her to have her
                                post swimming shower without the risk of unwanted eyes on her. While there is a focus on what happens in the Pool, I realised
                                from my research there is not enough thought or attention as to what happens outside the pool which can have an impact on
                                the safe guarding of our children.
